            <p>Uttarakhand has a total area of 53,483  km   of which 86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forests  .As per 2011 census total population of Uttarakhand state is 101.17 lacs out of which 69.45% is rural and 30.55% is urban population.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                As per the 19th livestock census 2012 in comparison to country Uttarakhand has 1.05% cattle, 0.91% buffaloes, 0.57% sheep, 1.01% goats, 0.19% pigs and 0.64% poultry. There has been a significant increase in the population of crossbred cattle and decrease in indigenous cattle population. Overall, total population of cattle has decreased.  Increase in cross breed population reflects the direct influence of the Breed Improvement Programs being carried out. There has been a decline in the population of buffaloes also. There was significant increase in population of sheep and goats, since 2007. This has been totally market driven as the demand for meat has been ever increasing. Interestingly there has been a very significant increase in poultry which may be attributed to increasing consumption trends of poultry meat and eggs.
