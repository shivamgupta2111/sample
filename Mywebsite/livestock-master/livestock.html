              <p class="card-text text-success">Uttarakhand possesses a huge natural resources base
                for livestock farming that includes common property
                resources and extensive grasslands â€“ subtropical, temperate and alpine. In addition, fodder is alternatively
                managed through stall feedings, the planting of fodder
                trees and cultivation of grasses on private land15. Climatic
                conditions are suitable, ranging from subtropical to
                temperate and alpine and provide suitability for livestock
                farming. Livestock farming is the second most important
                occupation of the people after agriculture, which helps
                substitute livelihoods of the poor marginal farmers
                through providing milk, manure, meat and wool.

                further shows how much we are able to maintain production and yield from livestock farming and how much it

                milching buffalo is tremendous, as it earns the highest
                income (36.7% and 22.1% respectively). This was mainly
                because of the increase in population of crossbreed
                milching cow and buffalo in the recent past, which
                resulted in increase in milk production as well. An
                increase in income share from cow and buffalo reveals that
                potential of milk and products made from it is significant

              <p class="card-text">We can divide the districts in the hills and plains for
                livestock farming. Suppose the hilly districts have less
                arable land and more forest and grazing land, livestock
                farming can be developed here. Further, the highlands are
                suitable for rearing of grazing animals, mainly goat,
                sheep and lamb. Meanwhile, in the valleys, middle altitudes and the highlands, milching livestock such as
                crossbreed cows and buffaloes can be reared. Although
                forest and pastureland in the plains are less, crop residues, like paddy straw (stall feeding) can meet livestock
                requirement. Need-based policies and their implementation is required for sustainable development of livestock.
                Dairy farming and small-scale wool and meat industries
                can be established. Government initiatives to provide
                market, cold storage and processing centres for milk,
                wool and meat products, and financial assistance to livestock herders during adverse circumstances are noteworthy. Similarly, community participation is inevitable to
                promote dairy farming.
